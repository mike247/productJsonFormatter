# What is this
Takes a flat array of product info and logs out a more nested readable version

## To Use
Simply run node index.js in the root directory, I was thinking of publishing this to npm but I ran out of time and it seemed a little overkill

## To Test with different data
Populate the rows.js file in the data folder with required test data

## Assumptions made
The productid was unique
The fields provided are the only fields recieved from the 'api'
Probably some more?

## Things used to help me
I used Airbnb's eslint, this has a bunch of things I dont need for react and jsx but it was easier than picking and choosing, for this use case it does the job!

I have an editor config to enforce spaces and line endings
